# Design an algorithm that finds the maximum positive integer input by a user.  The user repeatedly inputs numbers until a negative value is entered.
num_int = int(input("Input a number: "))    # Do not change this line
# Fill in the missing code
print("The maximum is", max_int)    # Do not change this line
